      I have been doing a lot of open-source and community work for the past few
      years. My open-source work has reached millions of developers, and I rank <TextualLink
        isYellow
        text='#2 on GitHub'
        href='https://x.com/kamrify/status/1750345095587754382'
        target='_blank'
      /> for the most-starred repositories. I am also the creator of <TextualLink
        isYellow
        href='https://roadmap.sh'
        text='roadmap.sh'
        target='_blank'
      />, which is one of the largest developer communities, ranks #7 on GitHub
      for the most-starred repositories and is visited by millions of developers
      every month.
    </p>

    <p class='mb-6'>
      Apart from all the community work, I have over 10 years of experience
      mostly working with startups and building products. I have built and
      scaled multiple products from scratch to millions of users and billions in
      revenue.
    </p>

    <p class='mb-6'>
      I owe a lot of my success to the amazing people I have met along the way.
      With the hope of doing the same for others, I am offering 15-minute chats
      to anyone who wants to talk about their projects, ideas, or anything else.
      I am happy to help in any way I can.

      I really value our time and want to make sure we get the most out of our
      chat. If you come with a few questions or ideas in mind, itâ€™ll help us
      dive right into a great conversation. Looking forward to it!
